// addEventListener(): in order for JavaScript to handle an event, we first need to tell it to listen for that event
// takes two arguments -> the name of the event to listen for, and a callback function to 'handle' the event

// Using an anonymous function (no name)
const input = document.getElementById('button');
input.addEventListener('click', function(){
    alert('I was clicked')
})

// Use a function name if you want to use it more than once
const input2 = document.getElementById('button');
function clickAlert(){
    alert('I was clicked')
}
input.addEventListener('click', clickAlert)
