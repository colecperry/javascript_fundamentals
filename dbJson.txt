/*
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
    It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
    JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as it is 
    both human-readable and language-independent.

    JSON is built on two structures:
    1. A collection of name/value pairs (often realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array).
    2. An ordered list of values (often realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence).

    The following is an example of a JSON object that contains information about a user, 
    including their personal details and a list of their favorite books.

    // Create a json server (create server for front end to send requests to) without creating backend server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server
*/

// Run the json server in the terminal:
json-server --watch db.json

// It should give you something like this: 
http://localhost:3000/user

// Open up postman and send a GET request -> you should see the json file
// Patch and delete need an id number
